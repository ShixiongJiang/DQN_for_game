# DQN_for_game Sekiro
Deep Q Learning can update its network by itself , using the reward feedback , which means we no longer need to collect our own data sets this time . All the data sets come from the real-time interaction between DQN network and the game.
By using this DQN network , you can fight any boss you want in the game .
